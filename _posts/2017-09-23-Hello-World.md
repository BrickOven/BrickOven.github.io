I haven't blogged in a long time so let's see how this goes. This is also my first thing posted on GitHub. Gotta figure these things out. Loved [Sarah Ford's blog](https://saraford.net) posting every day while she was learning Git.

Thanks to the folks who created GitHub and Jekyll for making this easy.

Now comes the hard party getting something posted at least once per week!

Check out the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
